Game plan:
- assign a number to each voter- voters with same number will be in a distruct together
- randomly draw districts about 50 times and record results
- try to make a gerrymandered district where minority had the more power than their population


  - randomize and take last n elements to make a district then calculate the lean, keep going over a set number of times and print out the time that is best for the minority- truly random
